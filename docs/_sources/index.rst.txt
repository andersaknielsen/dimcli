Welcome to DimCli's documentation!
==================================

Dimcli is a Python client for accessing the `Dimensions Analytics API <https://www.dimensions.ai>`_. 

If you want to see the API in action, a good place to start is the [Dimensions API Lab](https://api-lab.dimensions.ai/) and the official [API Documentation](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/).
